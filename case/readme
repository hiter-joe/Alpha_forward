# This example case is for Alpha_forward paper.

# In this folder, you can find the mesh/BC/IC for simulation.
# To simulate different cases, the user need to change the flow conditions in 0 folder.
# This case solves scalar transport in both the surface and subsurface domains. And 
the dynamic coupling at SWI is fully considered.
