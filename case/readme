# This example case is for Alpha_forward paper.

# In this folder, you can find the setup of simulation, like BC/IC.
# Before run the simulation, the user need to run blockmesh to generate the mesh files.

# Here, we added one example case, to simulate different cases, the user need to change the flow conditions in 0 folder or change the parameters in blockmesh file.

# This case solves scalar transport in both the surface and subsurface domains. And the dynamic coupling at SWI is fully considered.
